! Where the fuck do I start
  ? Draw the database schema
  - I need more informations about language difficulty
    - I can go really deep down in this rabbit hole.

! Error while running simple form on home page. It seems that @user is undefined. Of course it's not. But how do I test my form without that? Would javascript do a better job?
  ? Should I replace @user with something more meaningful?
  ? Should I code this form with JS?
  ? Is coding drunk a bad idea?
